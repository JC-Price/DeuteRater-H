as with combine_extracted_files, this provides some basic filtering and 
calculations that are relatively simple on their own, but need to be done and it's
easier here than in the main cacluation function

The main filters here are n value and sequence length must be sufficiently large
to be confident we are going to actually see good signal to noise. Finally we must
use the emass algorightm to calculate the unenriched relative isotopic envelope

may merge into combine_extracted_files.py
